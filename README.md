Whealton, C.A. (\<year>). "TaylorDiagrams-Code for creating a Taylor Diagram in R ". GitHub repository. https://github.com/calvinwhealton/TaylorDiagrams \<commit ID>, retrieved \<date>.


This repository contains code to generate Taylor diagrams, which are used when comparing models. The initial code was developed in reponse to a question of Stack Overflow (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24999338/r-taylor-diagram-plotting/32172086#32172086) because someone could not manipulate the Taylor diagram function from a package. The code in this repository is designed to be simple enough so that users can easily hack or modify the code to suit their specific needs.

The code is based on equations and descriptoins found in Taylor (2001, Summarizing multiple aspects of model performance in a single diagram, JGR: Atmospheres, http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2000JD900719/abstract) and http://www-pcmdi.llnl.gov/about/staff/Taylor/CV/Taylor_diagram_primer.pdf.
